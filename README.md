#Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

-The purpose of this analysis was to first obtain info re: the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for rural, suburban, and urban settings. The next step was to determine how total fares varied for each week for each city type. 


#Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
1. The rural setting had the fewest total rides, total drivers and total fares. 
2. The rural setting had the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
3. The urban setting at the highest total rides, total drivers, and total fare.
4. The urban setting had the lowest average fare per ride and the lowest average fare per driver.
5. The suburban setting was in the middle for total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
6. The line chart showed that the urban settings had the highest total fare, the rural the lowest total fare, and suburban in the middle (between rural and urban) for Jan, feb, march, april, and may. However these differences were smallest at the beginning of April and May, as for those weeks the total fare was the most similar amongst the rural, urban, and suburban settings.

#Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1. Recommend trying to find out why urban and suburban rides drop off so much at the beginning of April and May. It is crucial to get these back up as these dips are causing big drops in profits as urban/suburban rides are much more popular.
2. Recommend trying to find out why so few people are taking rural rides. These rides are the longest and cost the most per ride so if the number of rides go up even a little bit it will significantly increase profits.
3. Try to see if there is a shortage of rural drivers and if that is why rural rides are rare. If so try and hire more rural drivers. Rural drives have the highest fare per ride so it would be profitable to do so.
